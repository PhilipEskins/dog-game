## Description

_This application was designed to be a representation of what it means to own and take care of a dog, including the consequences. Our target audience are people who may work or go to school and only have a limited amount of time in the evenings. The ultimate goal once you begin the simulation, is to tire your dog out as much as possible before your bedtime- 21:00. The game starts at 16:00. You will be rewarded in cash as part of your simulated training, depending on how much energy your dog has before your bedtime._

_If your dog's energy level at 21:00 is between:_
* _0-10: you will earn $25 and have a good night's rest_
* _11-50: you will earn $15 and sleep well for most of the night_
* _51-90: you will earn $10, but not sleep very well_
* _91-100: you will not earn any money; you and your dog did not sleep well_

_To tire out your dog, you will have options to:_
1. _Play with your Dog_
2. _Walk your Dog_
3. _Take your Dog to the Park_
4. _Purchase toys with your current funds to tire out your dog more quickly when you Play with your Dog_

_Playing with your dog, taking your dog to the dog park and buying toys will add time, so be careful! You could spend up to two hours at the dog park depending on how many dogs are there._

_Make sure to check your dog's energy level throughout the evening. Your dog will nap if their energy level reaches 0 before 21:00 and will not wake up again tell they are fully recharged!_

_At the end of the day, you will be able to see how much you have earned and have an option to start a new day_

_So, as you see, if you are able to tire you dog out well before your bedtime, you and your dog will rest well, and you will be rewarded in cash! Everyone wins!_
